# Shortest-job-first-with-file-sync
Here in the project performs Shortest Job First/Shortest Job Next Algorithm which processes the data taken from the input file(data.txt) which contains the data for 50 sets of input generated from the randomized algorithm(random_inp_generator) and the output file(outp_file.txt) has the output generated by the algorithm.
